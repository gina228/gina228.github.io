I'm sitting cozy on my couch on a Sunday evening, winding down from a day of work as I write my first blog post on Learn. I wasn't sure how to go about it, but I went with the template idea of why I decided to go into Software Engineering and Development.

It's a long story, which I will try to narrow down into a nutshell, but it all stems from my love of design. 

I found myself at a crossroads after I finished a design track at another online coding/design school. I loved the school, the program, my mentor, and the projects! They even had a career services program to help you practice for your upcoming interviews and to give some support. I didn't realize how hard and mentally taxing the next couple of years (yes, years) were going to be while looking for a job. 

I applied consistently for about eight to nine months. I tracked every application in a Google Drive spreadsheet. I color coded everything. Applying to jobs was like having a second job. I would go to work, come home, search for jobs, apply to jobs, go to bed, repeat.

The job hunt became more of an on-and-off activity after I would get exhausted. I'd give it up for a bit, and then the cycle would continue. I wasn't having much luck. I wouldn't get interviews at all, or I would get to the interview but never make the final cut. It was really breaking me down. 

Through all of this, I have found the design world is very...how can I put it, opinionated? Someone either likes your designs or they don't. Rightfully so. Designs can be good designs, and they can be not-so-good. But, just because someone doesn't like your design, does it mean that your work is actually crappy? It was all very frustrating. The dreaded Imposter Syndrome was starting to set in.

*Am I not good enough for even an entry-level design job?

Did I just waste a lot of money on seemingly good education?

Are my designs actually terrible and everyone is secretly mocking me for thinking I did a good job?*

If I didn't know what Imposter Syndrom was before, I knew it at that point. I was told by my design mentor that everyone goes through it, beginner to advanced designers. He helped critique my projects and even helped me build a portfolio. So, if this is truly a thing that everyone feels at some point, why aren't designers more willing to tell you how you can make things better so you don't keep making the same mistakes. I don't even know what mistakes I was making!

I guess it just made me sad. I felt betrayed by the design world. I spent a lot of time working on my projects and doing school work while working full time just to have design professionals turn their back on one of their own who was trying to break into the field. 

Back to the original point of this blog post. I wanted to get into Software Engineering and Web Development BECAUSE of Imposter Syndrome. BECAUSE I felt that they would be good skills to have, even if I still wanted to be a designer. I felt it would make me more of a marketable job seeker. I love that coding is a very black and white skill. You either get it, or you don't. Your code either works or it doesn't. 

All I know is I don't feel as hopeless about my life direction anymore. I love learning new life skills that will benefit me.  I'm excited for the future again and look forward to it.
